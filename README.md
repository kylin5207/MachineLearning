**My way in Machine Learing**

    Today is the first day for me to study Machine Learning with Python. I want to get more progress in the future. So, I'd like to record my steps in this learning way.
    Maybe some views are wrong. I'm very glad to receive your suggestions.Thank you!
    Good luck!
    
    Acknowledge for Sebastian Raschka，I learn by his book 《PYTHON MACHINE LEARNING》.
